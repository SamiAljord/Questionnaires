## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install the package (node_modules)

Run 

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Step 2: Make sure that android and ios folders are built correctly
Run

```bash
$ yarn expo prebuild
```

### Step 3: Download the Application

Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
$ yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
$ yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
